# The Hi-Lo Card Game

The Hi-Lo Card GAme is a digital card game of chance. It is designed as a fun pass time for those who enjoy games such as solitairre but don't have enough room (e.g on public transit) or those who want to be able to access a card game at all times (when having internet access) and from any device. The cards are dealt and "shuffled" more randomly and simpler than a regular deck and so creates a more random and therefore "fair" game of probablility.

Users of this game will learn the rules from the rules box in the bottom left and can play fro as long as they want. This game can be used as a way to pass time or to simply enjoy. The site is targeted towards adults and teens primarily as the game concept could potentially be less interesting for a younger audience.

## Features

### Exisiting Features
- **Header**
  - Is featured at the top of the page.
  - It has no physical function (cannot be clicked and does not change whe hovered), instead it informs the user as to what the game ("Hi-Lo ~ Card Game") is and sets the tone for the styling in the rest of the page.
  - The font is playful and contrasts the dark backgorund with a light cream colour.

- **The Deck**
  - Situated on the left of the screen and varying in size depening on screen size, the deck functions as a deck would in a regular game. It deals the cards when clicked on.
  - Instructions on how to use the deck can be found in the instructions box at the bottom of the screen.
  - This button is functional and interactive once per round. After it is clicked it cannot be clicked again until the hi or lo button has been clicked.

- **Hi / Lo Buttons**
  - These buttons can be seen on the right of the screen on all screen sizes. They contrast with the background (dark green) by their light cream colour.
  - The function of these buttons is that when the user clicks either one they are gusessing whether the next card drawn will be higher or lower than the current card, once clicked the score at the bottom will go up / down depening on if the user is correct or not.
  - This is explained in the How to Play box.
  - If the user is incorrect an alert box will pop up at the top of the screen to tell the user they got one wrong and the correct count at the bottom right of the screen will go down (it can pass 0).

- **Play Area**
  - The play area is in the centre of the screen. When the deck is clicked a card (one of the 52) will appear here to display to the user so that they can educate their next guess.

- **Score Box**
  - The score box is next to / below the How to Play box (depending on screen size) and has three sets of scores: Correct, Wins & Losses.
  - The scores incriment depending on the users response i.e. the correct score goes up if the user gets on correct and down is the user gets one wrong, the wins score goes up when the user gets 13 correct and the losses score goes up every time the user gets one wrong.

## Testing
- I tested the game on different browsers: Firefox, Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
- Iconfirmed that the header, instructions, buttons, deck and scores are all readable and easy to understand.
- I confirm that the colours and fonts used are easy to read and are accessible by running it through lighthouse devtools.
- I confirm that the project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device bar.

Best practices is so low due to the use of an external image, however I found that this was necessary for my choice of button.
Again, the aspect ratios are off slightly, this is again due to the size I wanted my images to be on the smaller screens, therefore I do not believe this to be detrimental to the site.
